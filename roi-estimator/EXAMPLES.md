## Tips for Best Results

### Data Quality
- Use **measured** data whenever possible (e.g., from A/B tests, analytics)
- For estimates, be conservative and document assumptions
- Update the analysis as you gather more data

### Risk Assessment
- **Market Risk**: Consider user adoption, competition, market shifts
- **Technical Risk**: Evaluate complexity, dependencies, technical debt
- **Time Risk**: Account for scope creep, resource availability, blockers

### Confidence Inputs
- **High confidence** (70+): Based on A/B tests, measured data, minimal dependencies
- **Medium confidence** (40-70): Based on analogies, partial data, some dependencies
- **Low confidence** (<40): Based on intuition, estimates, many dependencies

### Presenting Results
1. Start with the **Base scenario** as your primary estimate
2. Show **Conservative** and **Aggressive** to demonstrate range
3. Highlight **confidence score** to set expectations
4. Call out **critical assumptions** that need validation
5. Address **dominant risks** with mitigation plans

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't use overly optimistic uplifts without evidence
- Don't ignore run costs (licenses, infrastructure, support)
- Don't forget ramp-up time (few initiatives have instant impact)
- Don't skip the confidence assessment (sponsors care about reliability)
